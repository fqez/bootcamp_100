## Bootcamp 100 days of Pyton meets Java

This repo will contain all de work proposed on the '100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp'.

The main objective of this is to recreate all this work (whenever possible)
 in Java/Spring, to refresh the fundamentals.

 ### Repo structure 🔱

 The `main` branch will contain the basic structure of each daywork, but it's just the scafolding for the work itself.

Each day will have its own separate tag with the following format: `day X - [some description]`. The tag will contain the actual source code of each day exercises both in java and python. The branching strategy will be as follows:

## How to test 🚀

I will be building an index of each day of code (it doesn't mean I will code everyday, or that I will do one day at a time; adult life is demanding, you know 😁). The index will redirect you to the specific tag of that day work. Jus read the README of each tag and follow the instructions!

Disclosure: probably I will f*** up the branches at some points, so expect a possible chaotic git history (not on purpose 😉)

## Index

| Day | Description | Tag | Completed |
| :--------: | -------- | :--------: | :--------: |
| Day 1  | Some description of the work day  | Day 1 - short desc.  | 🟢 |
