## Bootcamp 100 days of Pyton

This repo will contain all de work proposed on the '100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp'.

The main objective of this work is to refresh (and hopefuly learn new) concepts of Python in order to master the language. Starting with advanced level but refreshing basic concepts first.

 ### Repo structure 🔱

 The `Day-0` tag will contain the basic structure of each daywork, but it's just the scafolding for the work itself.

Each day will have its own separate tag with the following format: `day X - [some description]`. The tag will contain the actual source code of each day exercises both in java and python. The branching strategy will be as follows:

## How to test 🚀

I will be building an index of each day of code (it doesn't mean I will code everyday, or that I will do one day at a time; adult life is demanding, you know 😁). The index will redirect you to the specific tag of that day work. Jus read the README of each tag and follow the instructions!

Disclosure: probably I will f*** up the branches at some points, so expect a possible chaotic git history (not on purpose 😉)

## Index

| Day | Description | Tag | Completed |
| :--------: | -------- | :--------: | :--------: |
| Day 1  | Some description of the work day  | Day 1 - short desc.  | 🟢 |
